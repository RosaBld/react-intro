# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a solo project to learn React and Vite.JS.

Vite.JS wasn't mandatory to learn React but was an extra challenge that I decided on my own so that it will be kind of easier.

The goal of this project was to follow some steps and directions, given by a coach of the courses of BeCode, to learn React through a ToDo application.

Code was then given and needed to be adapted. The idea was to explain, step by step, what was going on and how to do what was needed to do.

## What you'll find here

In this ToDo App, you'll find the basics features of any ToDo App: adding a todo task with a beginning and ending date. Those tasks are displayed with all the informations that were given (dates and title). You can cross them with a checkbox so that the task will be marked as completed. You can then delete all completed tasks by clicking the delete button.

You can also Modify any tasks that you registered.

You can also check the calendar in the correct section. Unfortunatly, I wasn't able to display each tasks in the calendar at the corresponding date (like some known Calendar around the interweb).
